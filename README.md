# Ticket Price Prediction

This is a train ticket price prediction model that uses various features to predict ticket price. The dataset is the Spanish Rail Tickets Pricing - Renfe from Kaggle. This project uses extracted data from the original dataset for better computational efficiency. It was part of a DS & ML bootcamp I attended.
